# Gnome Bedtime Mode ![](./extras/images/bedtime-mode-icon.svg)

Hey Gnome, it's bedtime!

Converts to grayscale the entire Gnome workspace by using a smooth transition. Best to use during evening/night.

This behaviour is similar to Android's bedtime mode which converts the phone screen to grayscale. It should somewhat make your device less appealing and limit the usage of it before bedtime. On my side, at least, it still requires a fair amount of self control in order to make that happen.

The extension has a nice Preferences (Settings) UI where you can customize it to your liking:

- Set an automatic schedule for turning on/off the Bedtime Mode
- Add an On Demand button to Top Bar or a Quick Settings toggle to manually enable/disable the mode
- Control the On Demand button visibility, appearance and position in Top Bar
- Choose another color preset and intensity, if you prefer a different color scheme
- Change color intensity on the fly by scrolling over the On Demand button in Top Bar

Multi language support is also available. Please check the [Translators hall of fame](#translators) section for the supported languages list and [Guide for translators](#guide-for-translators) section if you want to contribute with a translation for your native language.

Peace! :sun_with_face:

# How can you contribute?

Help is always needed so if you found this extension helpful, the best way to contribute is to help with the creation of new translations (see next section).

If you encounter some bugs, please submit them as issues here on github. Also, feature requests or improvement ideas are welcomed.

# Guide for translators

If you like the extension and want to help in creating a translation for your native language, please carry on reading. :thumbsup:

Fork this github repository and clone your fork onto your local machine. Also, checkout the `next-release` branch:

```
git clone git@github.com:[your_github_username]/gnome-bedtime-mode.git
cd gnome-bedtime-mode/ && git checkout next-release
```

Run the `languages.sh` script with the `--new-locale=xx` argument in order to create a new translation file (you need to replace `xx` with your language code):

```
./scripts/languages.sh --new-locale=xx
```

Enter your email address when prompted and a new translation file should be succesfully generated into the `gnome-bedtime-mode/po` folder. It will have the name of the new locale and the `.po` extension.

Then, you just need to use a tool for opening the .po file and translate the texts. Popular choices are [ Gtranslator](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gnome.Gtranslator) and [POEdit](https://flathub.org/apps/details/net.poedit.Poedit).

When the new .po file is fully translated run the install script and the extension should be packaged with the new translations and installed to your Gnome shell:

```
./scripts/install.sh
```

After running the install script you need to re-login and manually enable the extension via an app or command line:

```
gnome-extensions enable gnomebedtime@ionutbortis.gmail.com
```

Open the extension preferences and check if all the texts are properly translated. If the new translations look fine push the changes and create a pull request to the `next-release` branch on the original repository.

That's it! You are now an official contributor to this extension, YaaY! :partying_face: :tada: :pray:

I wrote this extension because I use the Android's Bedtime Mode on a daily basis and I wanted something similar for my laptop. Having Ubuntu as my main OS, I liked the idea of extending the desktop shell to your liking. It was also a good way to improve on my JavaScript coding skills.

Many thanks to the creator of the [Night Theme Switcher](https://gitlab.com/rmnvgr/nightthemeswitcher-gnome-shell-extension/) extension. I used his code for reference since the Gnome Extensions Coding documentation was not that great when I first started.
